Explanation of Design Decisions

I had to support Cross Origin Resource Sharing by using app.options("/*", cors({origin: '*'})); 

Without this, my sample React application could not access my API. 

The fetch API running in the browser sends an options pre-flight check before the actual post. 

I used JOI for easy and efficient input validation. 

I created a helper function called extractAndTrim() to trim the input after input validation in order correctly format payloads that are sent to BoxKnight and Canada Post. 

In my endpoint, I put all of the rates into one array called allRates. 

This array is then traversed to find the optimal rate. 

I put the two API rate calls into two different try/catch blocks. 
This is done so that if one of the API calls fails and the other works, then a result will still be returned to the client. 

After the call to get the best rates from Canada Post and Boxknight, I insert a key to each returned rate objects. 
This key will be BK(BoxKnight) or CP(Canada Post). 
This key is for determining which shipping carrier is used when creating a shipment.
